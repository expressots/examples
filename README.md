A Typescript + [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/") lightweight framework for quick building scalable, easy to read and maintain, server-side applications 🚀

## Expresso TS Framework Community Demos

Welcome to the Expresso TS Framework Community Demos repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing demos and projects created by the Expresso TS Framework community members and the direct contributors of the framework. Our goal is to highlight the diverse applications and creative solutions built using Expresso TS Framework and inspire others to develop their own projects.

The demos in this repository cover a wide range of use cases and demonstrate various features and capabilities of the Expresso TS Framework. They serve as excellent learning resources for those who are new to the framework or looking for practical examples to incorporate into their own projects.

We encourage community members to contribute to this repository by sharing their own demos and projects. If you have a demo or project you would like to showcase, please feel free to submit a pull request, and we'll be happy to include it in this collection.

Happy coding, and thank you for being a part of the Expresso TS Framework community!
